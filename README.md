## What is mmdl ‚ùì

**TLDR**: MMDL is a cli app which allows you to quickly and efficiently download one or multiple songs from YouTube.

I wanted a tool to quickly and efficiently download songs/audios from YouTube based on the name of the song. I also wanted the songs to be tagged with metadata. This is why I created this simple to use tool.

### Why

- üïñ Fast: Thanks to *async code* and *multithreading*.
- ‚ö° Simple: Type `mmdl go`  and get started with downloading songs.
- ‚ú® Powerful
  - Find songs based on songs query/title
  - Skip already existing songs
  - Add metadata such as artist name and artwork

## Requirements üëá

- Python 3

- FFmpeg

  *Here is a quick guide: https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg*

## Install ‚ù§Ô∏è

*Make sure you have installed FFmpeg. Else this programm won‚Äôt work.*

```bash
pip install -U mmdl
```

‚ö° **That‚Äôs it!** ‚ö°

Mmdl has been only been tested using Python 3.9. 
## Usage üî•

### Go

*Very quick and easy way of running the cli. Few questions will be asked via prompts. **This is the recommended way!***

```shell
mmdl go
```

### Download

*Fast and traditional way of running the cli. Pass arguments and have your songs downloaded. Useful for automation scripts.*

```shell
mmdl download <method> #(add -h for more information)
```

#### Methods

- **File** `mmdl download file <location>`: Get songs from file. Then download them.
- **List** `mmdl download list "Term1" "Term2" ...` or `mmdl download list -a` for a prompt: Add multiple songs as cli arguments or enter them in a prompt.
- **YTMusic** (beta) `mmdl download ytmusi` : Download multiple songs from *YouTube Music liked songs playlist* (via parsing HTML)
- **Single** `mmdl download single song name`: Download a single song.
